    "# Q6: What is train, test, and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.\n",
    "# When developing machine learning models, it is common to split the available data into three subsets: the training set, the test set, and the validation set. Here's an explanation of each term and its importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Training Set: The training set is the portion of the data used to train the machine learning model. It contains labeled examples where both the input data and their corresponding target outputs are known. The model learns from this data to generalize patterns and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test Set: The test set is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. It contains unseen examples that the model hasn't been exposed to during training. By evaluating the model's predictions on the test set, we can estimate its performance on new, unseen data. It helps us assess the model's ability to generalize and make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Validation Set: The validation set is an optional subset of the data used for model selection and hyperparameter tuning. It helps in evaluating different variations of the model and tuning parameters to improve performance. The validation set provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance before applying it to the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The importance of these splits lies in assessing the model's performance on unseen data and preventing overfitting. By using separate sets for training, testing, and validation, we can obtain a more realistic estimation of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?\n",
    "# Unsupervised learning can be utilized for anomaly detection by learning patterns and structures in unlabeled data. Anomalies are data points that significantly deviate from the norm or expected behavior. Here's a general approach for using unsupervised learning in anomaly detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train an unsupervised learning algorithm on a dataset without any labeled anomalies. The algorithm will learn the underlying structures and patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Once the model is trained, it can be used to generate predictions or assign scores to new, unseen data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data points that receive low scores or are dissimilar to the majority of the data can be considered potential anomalies. These points are likely to represent unusual or abnormal behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "# By setting appropriate thresholds or using additional techniques, such as clustering or density estimation, the unsupervised model can identify and flag potential anomalies for further investigation or action.\n",
