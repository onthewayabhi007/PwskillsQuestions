    "# Q1. The difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Label Encoding: Label Encoding is a method of converting categorical variables into numerical form. It assigns a unique numerical label to each unique category in the variable. For example, if we have a variable \"Color\" with categories \"red,\" \"green,\" and \"blue,\" Label Encoding would assign the labels 0, 1, and 2 to these categories, respectively. Label Encoding does not introduce any specific order or hierarchy among the categories.\n",
    "# Ordinal Encoding: Ordinal Encoding is also used to convert categorical variables into numerical form. However, in this case, the labels are assigned based on the order or ranking of the categories. For example, if we have a variable \"Size\" with categories \"small,\" \"medium,\" and \"large,\" Ordinal Encoding would assign labels 0, 1, and 2, respectively, to reflect the order of sizes from smallest to largest. The assigned labels capture the ordinal relationship between the categories.\n",
    "# When to choose one over the other:\n",
    "\n",
    "# If there is no inherent order or ranking among the categories, and the variable is purely nominal, Label Encoding is appropriate. For example, if we have a variable \"Country\" with categories \"USA,\" \"Canada,\" and \"Germany,\" Label Encoding can be used.\n",
    "# If there is a clear order or hierarchy among the categories, and the variable is ordinal, Ordinal Encoding is suitable. For example, if we have a variable \"Education Level\" with categories \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's,\" \"Master's,\" and \"PhD,\" Ordinal Encoding can be used to capture the educational progression.\n",
    "# Q2. Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "# Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on their relationship with the target variable. It assigns ordinal labels to the categories by considering the target variable's mean or median value for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The steps for Target Guided Ordinal Encoding are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate the mean or median target value for each category of the categorical variable.\n",
    "# Sort the categories based on their target mean or median values.\n",
    "# Assign ordinal labels(integers) to the sorted categories.\n",
    "# Replace the original categorical values with the assigned ordinal labels.\n",
    "# Example usage: Suppose we have a dataset with a categorical variable \"City\" and a target variable \"Average Salary.\" We can use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to encode the \"City\" variable based on the average salary of each city. This encoding can capture the relationship between the city and the average salary, allowing the model to learn from this ordinal information.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. Covariance:\n",
    "# Covariance is a statistical measure that quantifies the relationship between two variables. It indicates how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable. Covariance can be positive, negative, or zero, reflecting the nature and strength of the relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it provides insights into the linear relationship between variables. It helps in understanding the direction and magnitude of the relationship, which is useful for various purposes such as feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and assessing the strength of association in regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The covariance between two variables X and Y is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "# cov(X, Y) = Σ[(Xᵢ - μₓ)(Yᵢ - μᵧ)] / (n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# where Xᵢ and Yᵢ are the individual data points, μₓ and μᵧ are the means of X and Y, and n is the number of data points.\n"
