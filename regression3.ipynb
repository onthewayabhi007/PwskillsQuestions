    "# Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "# A1. Lasso Regression, short for \"Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator\" Regression, is a linear regression technique that adds a regularization term to the ordinary least squares(OLS) loss function. The regularization term is a penalty based on the absolute values of the coefficients, which helps in feature selection and prevents overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The primary difference between Lasso Regression and other regression techniques(e.g., ordinary linear regression, ridge regression) lies in the type of regularization applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Lasso Regression uses L1 regularization, which adds the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients to the loss function. This leads to some coefficients being exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Ridge Regression, on the other hand, uses L2 regularization, which adds the sum of the squared values of the coefficients to the loss function. It penalizes large coefficients but doesn't typically set them exactly to zero, so Ridge Regression keeps all features in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The difference in regularization terms results in different behaviors and applications of the two techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "# A2. The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is that it automatically performs feature selection by setting some coefficients to exactly zero. This means that Lasso can effectively identify and exclude irrelevant or less important features from the model, leading to a more parsimonious and interpretable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# By contrast, other regression techniques like ordinary linear regression or ridge regression do not perform automatic feature selection, and all features are included in the model, even if they have little or no predictive power. Lasso's ability to select features makes it particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets with many features, as it can simplify the model and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
    "\n",
    "# A3. Interpreting the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model is similar to interpreting coefficients in linear regression. The coefficients represent the relationship between each feature and the target variable, taking into account the impact of the other features in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# However, due to the L1 regularization in Lasso, some coefficients may be exactly zero, which means the corresponding features are excluded from the model. For the non-zero coefficients, their signs and magnitudes indicate the direction and strength of the relationship between the corresponding feature and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# It's important to keep in mind that Lasso's feature selection property can result in a more interpretable model with only the most relevant features, but interpreting the coefficients still requires caution, as the relationships between the features and the target may change when other features are added or removed from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the model's performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "# A4. The main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is the regularization parameter, often denoted as \"λ\" (lambda). The regularization parameter controls the strength of the L1 penalty applied to the coefficients. A higher value of λ increases the penalty, leading to more coefficients being set exactly to zero, thus performing stronger feature selection. Conversely, a lower value of λ reduces the penalty, allowing more coefficients to remain non-zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Finding the appropriate value of λ is crucial for the model's performance. If λ is too large, the model may underfit by excluding important features. If λ is too small or zero, Lasso becomes equivalent to ordinary linear regression, and the model may overfit, especially in high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# To choose the optimal value of λ, one common approach is to use cross-validation. The data is split into multiple folds, and the model is trained on different combinations of training and validation sets. The value of λ that results in the best cross-validated performance(e.g., lowest mean squared error or highest R-squared) is selected as the optimal value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "# A5. Lasso Regression is inherently a linear regression technique, so it is suitable for linear regression problems. However, it can be extended to handle non-linear regression problems by applying basis function expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basis function expansion involves transforming the original features into a set of new features using non-linear transformations. For example, you could take polynomial features of higher degrees, exponentials, logarithms, or other non-linear transformations of the input features. Once the basis function expansion is performed, Lasso Regression can be applied to the expanded feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Keep in mind that the choice of basis functions and the degree of expansion may have a significant impact on the model's performance and can lead to potential overfitting. Therefore, it is essential to validate the model using cross-validation and other techniques to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. What is the difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "# A6. The main difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression lies in the type of regularization used:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Ridge Regression(L2 regularization): In Ridge Regression, the regularization term added to the ordinary least squares loss function is the sum of the squared values of the coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter(λ). This encourages smaller coefficients but doesn't force any coefficient to be exactly zero. Ridge Regression tends to shrink coefficients towards zero but retains all features in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Lasso Regression(L1 regularization): In Lasso Regression, the regularization term added to the loss function is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter(λ). Lasso has the property of exact feature selection, as it can force some coefficients to be exactly zero, effectively excluding certain features from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# So, the key distinction is that Ridge Regression is more suitable when you want to prevent overfitting and reduce the impact of less important features, but you believe that all features are potentially relevant. Lasso Regression, on the other hand, is more appropriate when you have reason to believe that some features are truly irrelevant and should be excluded from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7. Can Lasso Regression handle multicollinearity in the input features? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "# A7. Yes, Lasso Regression can help in dealing with multicollinearity in the input features to some extent, but it does so indirectly. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more features in the dataset are highly correlated with each other, which can lead to unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates in linear regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Lasso Regression, the L1 regularization has the effect of \"shrinkage,\" meaning it reduces the magnitudes of the coefficients. When multicollinearity is present, it might drive the coefficients of the correlated features to be close to each other or even exactly zero. This can help in feature selection, effectively preferring one of the correlated features over the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "# However, Lasso's feature selection depends on the strength of the correlations and the data itself. In some cases, it may still retain one of the correlated features, especially if their combined predictive power is strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "# It's essential to remember that while Lasso can mitigate multicollinearity to some extent, it's not a direct solution for the problem. Other techniques, like Principal Component Analysis(PCA) or Ridge Regression, are also commonly used to address multicollinearity more explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q8. How do you choose the optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression?\n",
